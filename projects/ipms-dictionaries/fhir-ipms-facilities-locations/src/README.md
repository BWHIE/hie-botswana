### MFL Identifier: 
We arbitrarily chose an MFL identifier system because it didn't initially exist in the `Shared Health Records` configuration. The choice was made in order to be able to map the obtained mock MFL codes in FHIR resources. See `bwConfig:MflfacilityCodeSystemUrl` in `config.json` file.
